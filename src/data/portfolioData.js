"I'm a full-stack developer who builds high-performance, scalable web applications using the MERN stack, TypeScript, and Next.js. On the frontend, I design and implement responsive, user-friendly interfaces that drive engagement. On the backend, I architect robust Node.js/Express APIs,  MongoDB databases, and secure access with JWT. I’ve deployed and maintained apps in cloud environments containerized with Docker, automated through CI/CD pipelines, and hosted on AWS ensuring reliability and smooth performance. I write clean, maintainable code that balances business objectives with user needs. Let’s turn your next idea into a thoughtfully engineered digital experience.",
